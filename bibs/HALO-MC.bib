abstract = {The third phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment added an array of 3He proportional counters to the detector. The purpose of this neutral-current detection (NCD) array was to observe neutrons resulting from neutral-current solar-neutrino–deuteron interactions. We have developed a detailed simulation of current pulses from NCD array proportional counters, from the primary neutron capture on 3He through NCD array signal- processing electronics. This NCD array MC simulation was used to model the alpha-decay background in SNO’s third-phase 8B solar-neutrino measurement.},
