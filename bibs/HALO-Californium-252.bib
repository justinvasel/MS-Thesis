abstract = {This document is intended to serve as a comprehensive applications guide to passive neutron multiplicity counting, a new nondestructive assay (NDA) technique developed over the past ten years. The document describes the principles of multiplicity counter design, electronics, and mathematics. Existing counters in Department of Energy (DOE) facilities are surveyed, and their operating requirements and procedures and defined. Current applications to plutonium material types found in DOE facilities are described, and estimates of the expected assay precision and bias are given. Lastly, guidelines for multiplicity counter selection and procurement are summarized. The document also includes a detailed collection of references on passive neutron coincidence and multiplicity publications over the last ten to fifteen years.},

abstract = {The spontaneous-fission neutron spectrum of '"Cf has been measured from 0.003 to 15.0 MeV by time- of-flight techniques. A hydrogenous liquid scintillator was used as a detector at the higher energies, while a 'Li-loaded glass scintillator was used at the lower energies. The measured spectrum has an average energy of 2.348 MeV. A Maxwellian distribution, X(E)\~{}E'\~{}' exp (—E/1.565), 6ts the data well for 0.5 \&E \&10.0 MeV. Below 0.1 MeV, N(E) has a Q Edependence but with values \~{}25'\%\%uo larger than those predicted by the extended Maxwellian spectrum. The results are interpreted in terms of a simplified evaporation model.},

@article{Smith1957,
abstract = {The spontaneous fission neutron spectrum of Cf'" from 0.2 to 7.0 Mev has been measured. Time-of-Aight techniques were employed to determine the lower energy portion of the spectrum while proton recoils in emulsions were used to study the higher energy neutrons. The measured neutron spectrum is, within the experimental accuracy, described by the empirical relation N(E) \~{} exp/ —088E(Mev) g sinhI 20E (Mev)g\&, where X(E) is the number of neutrons of energy E per unit energy interval. The experimental results are compared with the theoretically determined CP52 fission neutron spectrum.},

abstract = {Results on the radiation hardness of photodiodes to fast neutrons are presented. Four photodiodes (three avalanche photodiodes from two manufacturers, and one PIN photodiode) were exposed to neutrons from a Cf source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The e!ects of this radiation on many parameters such as gain, intrinsic dark current, quantum e\$ciency, noise, capacitance, and voltage and temperature coe\$cients of the gain for these devices for \#uences up to \&2Y10 neutrons/cm are shown and discussed. While degradation of APDs occurred during neutron irradiation, they remained photosensitive devices with gain.},
