The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) at SNOLAB in Canada is the world's first dedicated supernova neutrino detector. Construction of the detector is complete, but there is still work to be done before it is fully operational. In this thesis, I describe my contributions to the HALO experiment which include the testing of hardware, the design of a redundant networking scheme, and the development and implementation of a remote monitoring system.
