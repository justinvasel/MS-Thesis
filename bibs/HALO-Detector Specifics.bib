abstract = {The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) is a dedicated supernova neutrino detector under construction at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Ontario. HALO will utilize 76 tonnes of lead blocks in order to take advantage of the high neutrino cross-section and low neutron absorp- tion cross-section of lead. Charged and neutral current neutrino interactions in lead expel neutrons from the lead nuclei making a burst of detected neutrons the signature for the de- tection of a supernova. The focus of this thesis is three fold. The primary purpose is to determine the secondary creep characteristics of the lead blocks in HALO. The goal is to provide input to the engineer- ing design of the lead array and its supporting superstructure. The secondary creep rate was established for four lead blocks at varying loads. The creep behaviour of lead was extrapo- lated beyond the test times in order to predict the behaviour over ten years. The predicted creep behaviour demonstrated that several layers in the HALO lead array required structural reinforcement in order to protect the structural integrity of the experiment and the sensitive equipment within the bores of lead. In order to mitigate the creep process steel support rings have been inserted in the bore of each block in layers 1-5. This thesis also focuses on minimizing lead contamination in the SNOLAB facilities, a class 2000 clean room. Lead is a toxic metal that can have harmful effects on almost all body systems. Lead carbonate can become suspended in air as fine particles through handling. Not only does this represent an unacceptable contaminant, the presence of lead represents a health hazard. In order to mitigate this hazard the HALO lead blocks were painted. A program to iii determine the optimal paint and application method was performed. It was determined that Tremclad Rust Paint in green had the optimal properties for this application. Finally, Monte Carlo studies were performed to optimize the design of the HALO exper- iment and determine its sensitivity for the detection of neutrinos from galactic supernovae. Detailed studies of material selection and geometric optimization demonstrated that graphite is the optimum material to act as a reflector. The addition of a 15 cm graphite reflector on five sides of the lead array with water and polypropylene shielding improves the neutron detection efficiency by ∼21.5\%. The detection efficiency was also optimized by selecting 3He proportional counter supports that can also act as moderators within the experiment. This simulation set demonstrated that for a shielded HALO detector with a graphite reflector the highest feasible efficiency of detected neutrons occured for a moderator geometry of four 3.0” HDPE tubes with 1.02 cm wall thickness. Monte Carlo simulations were also performed in order to determine the expected neutron capture rate in HALO due to background neutrons. Studies to optimize the geometry of the shielding indicated that 1 ft3 water boxes surrounding five sides and an 0.20 m thick polypropylene base layer reduced the detection of external neutrons from 2286 neutrons/day to 649 neutrons/day. Furthermore, the effect of $\gamma$ radiation from radioactive decay of the paint coating on the HALO blocks was shown to give an energy below the neutron energy window.},

abstract = {Neutrinos in the few tens of MeV range will produce neutrons when interacting with lead via both charged and neutral current interactions. The production of single and double neutron events is highly dependent on neutrino energy. The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) is a detector designed to exploit the neutrino-lead interaction in order to measure a burst of neutrinos from a nearby supernova. HALO is under construction at SNOLAB, making use of recycled lead ingots and 3He counters from the SNO detectors. The relative rates of single and double neutrons observed for a supernova burst will give unique information about the spectra of $\nu$e as well as $\nu$$\mu$,$\tau$ neutrinos and antineutrinos. Here we present studies of the sensitivity to different supernova models and neutrino oscillation parameters of the 79 ton HALO1 detector and of a planned future upgrade to 1 kton of lead.},

@article{Kaiser2011,
abstract = {First we want to present predictions for 1 and 2 neutron interaction rates in HALO calculated by Vaananen and Volpe [5]. We show how to infer ‘real’ event numbers from the data. Since this process implies errors we estimate systematic errors using a graphical approach and statistical errors using an analytic approach. Then we combine both kinds of errors and superimpose the resulting error ellipses with the models from the Vaananen and Volpe paper. As a second method we use a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate error contours and compare them with those models as well. Finally we determine how the detector efficiency influences the physics sensitivity.},

abstract = {The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) is a dedicated supernova detector constructed in the underground facilities at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Canada. It is designed to detect neutrinos from a supernova within the Milky Way galaxy using lead blocks and 3He neutron detectors. Analysis of supernova neutrino events can produce new discoveries in astrophysics and fundamental particle physics. HALO will be a participant in the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS), which will rely on the time delay between neutrino emission and visible light emission to provide notification to astronomers of an imminent observable supernova. This article discusses the data acquisition system of HALO, including the software ORCA, electronics components, data flow, and the design of the high-voltage and signal connections for the 3He neutron detectors.},
