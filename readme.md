My Physics M.S. Thesis

##### Under The Hood: Preparing the Helium and Lead Observatory for Full Operation

>The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) at SNOLAB in Canada is the world's first dedicated supernova neutrino detector. Construction of the detector is complete, but there is still work to be done before it is fully operational. In this thesis, I describe my contributions to the HALO experiment which include the testing of hardware, the design of a redundant networking scheme, and the development and implementation of a remote monitoring system.

**The code is currently a little sloppy and poorly documented.** Major revisions will be coming soon. Check back...

This is the source code for my M.S. Thesis.

It must be compiled using XeLaTeX, and you will have to change some font definitions in thesis.tex if you do not have the fonts installed that I do (which is likely the case).

A PDF version of my thesis is in the TeX/ folder.
