abstract = {Supernova theory, numerical and analytic, has made remarkable progress in the past decade. This progress was made possible by more sophisticated simulation tools, especially for neutrino transport, improved microphysics, and deeper insights into the role of hydrodynamic instabilities. Violent, large-scale nonradial mass motions are generic in supernova cores. The neutrino-heating mechanism, aided by nonradial flows, drives explosions, albeit low-energy ones, of ONeMg-core and some Fe-core progenitors. The characteristics of the neutrino emission from new-born neutron stars were revised, new features of the gravitational-wave signals were discovered, our notion of supernova nucleosynthesis was shattered, and our understanding of pulsar kicks and explosion asymmetries was significantly improved. But simulations also suggest that neutrino-powered explosions might not explain the most energetic supernovae and hypernovae, which seem to demand magnetorotational driving. Now that modeling is being advanced from two to three dimensions, more realism, new perspectives, and hopefully answers to long-standing questions are coming into reach.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernovae are among the most fascinating phenomena in astrophysics and provide a formidable challenge for theoretical investigation. They mark the spectacular end of the lives of massive stars and, in an explosive eruption, release as much energy as the sun produces during its whole life. A better understanding of the astrophysical role of supernovae as birth sites of neutron stars, black holes, and heavy chemical elements, and more reliable predictions of the observable signals from stellar death events are tightly linked to the solution of the long-standing puzzle how collapsing stars achieve to explode. In this article our current knowledge of the processes that contribute to the success of the explosion mechanism are concisely reviewed. After a short overview of the sequence of stages of stellar core-collapse events, the general properties of the progenitor-dependent neutrino emission will be briefly described. Applying sophisticated neutrino transport in axisymmetric (2D) simulations with general relativity as well as in simulations with an approximate treatment of relativistic effects, we could find successful neutrino-driven explosions for a growing set of progenitor stars. First results of three-dimensional (3D) models have been obtained, and magnetohydrodynamic simulations demonstrate that strong initial magnetic fields in the pre-collapse core can foster the onset of neutrino-powered supernova explosions even in nonrotating stars. These results are discussed in the context of the present controversy about the value of 2D simulations for exploring the supernova mechanism in realistic 3D environments, and they are interpreted against the background of the current disagreement on the question whether the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection is the crucial agency that supports the onset of the explosion.},

abstract = {By a series of independent decisions, an international network of massive underground neutrino detectors is being established whose collective sensitivity to supernova neutrinos will be unprecedented. Individually and in coordinated fashion, these detectors could provide temporal, energetic, angular, and flavor information for any stellar collapse in our Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, or the Small Magellanic Cloud. In this paper, we construct a detailed fiducial model of supernova neutrino bursts that incorporates the numerous emission features derived and predicted by supernova and protoneutron star theorists during the last decade. With this generic model, we calculate and predict the response of representative \v{C}erenkov and scintillation neutrino telescopes to a nearby neutrino burst. The strengths and weaknesses of the various detectors are highlighted and explored. We focus on the information-rich features of the neutrino signal that were not detectable from SN 1987A. In addition, we investigate the effect of a nonzero neutrino mass on the detected signals. The latter study focuses on what can be derived with high-resolution observations of a galactic collapse.},

abstract = {We study the dependence of the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism for core-collapse supernovae on the equation of state. Using a simplified treatment of the neutrino physics with a parameterized neutrino luminosity, we explore the relationship between explosion time, mass accretion rate, and neutrino luminosity for a 15 Msun progenitor in 1D and 2D. We test three different equations of state commonly used in core-collapse simulations: the models of Lattimer \& Swesty (1991) with incompressibility of 180 MeV and 220 MeV, and the model of Shen et al. (1998), in order of increasing stiffness. We find that for a given neutrino luminosity the time after bounce until explosion increases with the stiffness of the equation of state: the Lattimer \& Swesty EOS explode more easily than that of Shen et al. We find this holds in both 1D and 2D, while for all models explosions are obtained more easily in 2D than in 1D. We also discuss the relevance of approximate instability criteria to realistic simulations.},

abstract = {Core-collapse theory brings together many facets of high-energy and nuclear astrophysics and the numerical arts to present theorists with one of the most important, yet frustrating, astronomical questions: "What is the mechanism of core-collapse supernova explosions?" A review of all the physics and the fifty-year history involved would soon bury the reader in minutiae that could easily obscure the essential elements of the phenomenon, as we understand it today. Moreover, much remains to be discovered and explained, and a complicated review of an unresolved subject in flux could grow stale fast. Therefore, in this paper I describe what I think are various important facts and perspectives that may have escaped the attention of those interested in this puzzle. Furthermore, I attempt to describe the modern theory's physical underpinnings and briefly summarize the current state of play. In the process, I identify a few myths (as I see them) that have crept into modern discourse. However, there is much more to do and humility in the face of this age-old challenge is clearly the most prudent stance as we seek its eventual resolution.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernovae are among the most energetic cosmic cataclysms. They are prodigious emitters of neutrinos and quite likely strong galactic sources of gravitational waves. Observation of both neutrinos and gravitational waves from the next galactic or near extragalactic core-collapse supernova will yield a wealth of information on the explosion mechanism, but also on the structure and angular momentum of the progenitor star, and on aspects of fundamental physics such as the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities and low entropies. In this contribution to the proceedings of the Neutrino 2012 conference, we summarize recent progress made in the theoretical understanding and modeling of core-collapse supernovae. In this, our emphasis is on multi-dimensional processes involved in the explosion mechanism such as neutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion shock instability. As an example of how supernova neutrinos can be used to probe fundamental physics, we discuss how the rise time of the electron antineutrino flux observed in detectors can be used to probe the neutrino mass hierarchy. Finally, we lay out aspects of the neutrino and gravitational-wave signature of core-collapse supernovae and discuss the power of combined analysis of neutrino and gravitational wave data from the next galactic core-collapse supernova.},

abstract = {We have conducted a series of numerical experiments using spherically symmetric, general relativistic, neutrino radiation hydrodynamics with the code Agile-BOLTZTRAN to examine the effects of modern neutrino opacities on the development of supernova simulations. We test the effects of opacities by removing opacities or by undoing opacity improvements for individual opacities and groups of opacities. We find that improvements to electron capture (EC) on nuclei, namely EC on an ensemble of nuclei using modern nuclear structure models rather than the simpler independent-particle approximation (IPA) for EC on a mean nucleus, plays the most important role during core collapse of all tested neutrino opacities. Low-energy neutrinos emitted by modern nuclear EC preferentially escape during collapse without the energy downscattering on electrons required to enhance neutrino escape and deleptonization for the models with IPA nuclear EC. During shock breakout the primary influence on the emergent neutrinos arises from NIS on electrons. For the accretion phase, non-isoenergetic scattering on free nucleons and pair emission by \$e\^{}+e\^{}-\$ annihilation have the largest impact on the neutrino emission and shock evolution. Other opacities evaluated, including nucleon--nucleon bremsstrahlung and especially neutrino--positron scattering, have little measurable impact on neutrino emission or shock dynamics. Modern treatments of nuclear electron capture, \$e\^{}+e\^{}-\$-annihilation pair emission, and non-isoenergetic scattering on electrons and free nucleons are critical elements of core-collapse simulations of all dimensionality.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernova neutrinos undergo a variety of phenomena when they travel from the high neutrino density region and large matter densities to the Earth. We perform analytical calculations of the supernova neutrino fluxes including collective effects due to the neutrino-neutrino interactions, the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect due to the neutrino interactions with the background matter and decoherence of the wave packets as they propagate in space. We predict the numbers of one- and two-neutron charged and neutral-current electron-neutrino scattering on lead events. We show that, due to the energy thresholds, the ratios of one- to two-neutron events are sensitive to the pinching parameters of neutrino fluxes at the neutrinosphere, almost independently of the presently unknown neutrino properties. Besides, such events have an interesting sensitivity to the spectral split features that depend upon the presence/absence of energy equipartition among neutrino flavors. Our calculations show that a lead-based observatory like the Helium And Lead Observatory (HALO) has the potential to pin down important characteristics of the neutrino fluxes at the neutrinosphere, and provide us with information on the neutrino transport in the supernova core.},
