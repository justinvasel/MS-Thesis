We explore the interplay between the neutrino-neutrino interaction and the effects of multiple resonances upon the time signal of positrons in supernova observatories. A specific signature is found for the inverted hierarchy and a large third neutrino mixing angle and we predict, in this case, a dearth of lower energy positrons in Cherenkov detectors midway through the neutrino signal and the simultaneous revelation of valuable information about the original fluxes. We show that this feature is also observable with current generation neutrino detectors at the level of several sigmas.},

abstract = {A future galactic SN can be located several hours before the optical explosion through the MeV-neutrino burst, exploiting the directionality of \$\backslash nu\$-\$e\$-scattering in a water Cherenkov detector such as Super-Kamiokande. We study the statistical efficiency of different methods for extracting the SN direction and identify a simple approach that is nearly optimal, yet independent of the exact SN neutrino spectra. We use this method to quantify the increase in the pointing accuracy by the addition of gadolinium to water, which tags neutrons from the inverse beta decay background. We also study the dependence of the pointing accuracy on neutrino mixing scenarios and initial spectra. We find that in the ``worst case'' scenario the pointing accuracy is \$8\^{}\backslash circ\$ at 95\% C.L. in the absence of tagging, which improves to \$3\^{}\backslash circ\$ with a tagging efficiency of 95\%. At a megaton detector, this accuracy can be as good as \$0.6\^{}\backslash circ\$. A TeV-neutrino burst is also expected to be emitted contemporaneously with the SN optical explosion, which may locate the SN to within a few tenths of a degree at a future km\$\^{}2\$ high-energy neutrino telescope. If the SN is not seen in the electromagnetic spectrum, locating it in the sky through neutrinos is crucial for identifying the Earth matter effects on SN neutrino oscillations.},

We study the dependence of the pointing accuracy on the arrival time resolution of supernova neutrinos at different detectors. For a failed supernova, we expect better results due to the abrupt termination of the neutrino emission which allows one to measure the arrival time with higher precision. We found that for the time resolution of \$\backslash pm\$ 2 (4) ms, the supernova can be located with a precision of \$\backslash sim\$ 5 (10)\$\^{}\backslash circ\$ on the declination and of \$\backslash sim\$ 8 (15)\$\^{}\backslash circ\$ on the right ascension angle, if we combine the observations from detectors at four different sites.},

abstract = {Supernova theory, numerical and analytic, has made remarkable progress in the past decade. This progress was made possible by more sophisticated simulation tools, especially for neutrino transport, improved microphysics, and deeper insights into the role of hydrodynamic instabilities. Violent, large-scale nonradial mass motions are generic in supernova cores. The neutrino-heating mechanism, aided by nonradial flows, drives explosions, albeit low-energy ones, of ONeMg-core and some Fe-core progenitors. The characteristics of the neutrino emission from new-born neutron stars were revised, new features of the gravitational-wave signals were discovered, our notion of supernova nucleosynthesis was shattered, and our understanding of pulsar kicks and explosion asymmetries was significantly improved. But simulations also suggest that neutrino-powered explosions might not explain the most energetic supernovae and hypernovae, which seem to demand magnetorotational driving. Now that modeling is being advanced from two to three dimensions, more realism, new perspectives, and hopefully answers to long-standing questions are coming into reach.},

abstract = {The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) is a dedicated supernova neutrino detector under construction at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Ontario. HALO will utilize 76 tonnes of lead blocks in order to take advantage of the high neutrino cross-section and low neutron absorp- tion cross-section of lead. Charged and neutral current neutrino interactions in lead expel neutrons from the lead nuclei making a burst of detected neutrons the signature for the de- tection of a supernova. The focus of this thesis is three fold. The primary purpose is to determine the secondary creep characteristics of the lead blocks in HALO. The goal is to provide input to the engineer- ing design of the lead array and its supporting superstructure. The secondary creep rate was established for four lead blocks at varying loads. The creep behaviour of lead was extrapo- lated beyond the test times in order to predict the behaviour over ten years. The predicted creep behaviour demonstrated that several layers in the HALO lead array required structural reinforcement in order to protect the structural integrity of the experiment and the sensitive equipment within the bores of lead. In order to mitigate the creep process steel support rings have been inserted in the bore of each block in layers 1-5. This thesis also focuses on minimizing lead contamination in the SNOLAB facilities, a class 2000 clean room. Lead is a toxic metal that can have harmful effects on almost all body systems. Lead carbonate can become suspended in air as fine particles through handling. Not only does this represent an unacceptable contaminant, the presence of lead represents a health hazard. In order to mitigate this hazard the HALO lead blocks were painted. A program to iii determine the optimal paint and application method was performed. It was determined that Tremclad Rust Paint in green had the optimal properties for this application. Finally, Monte Carlo studies were performed to optimize the design of the HALO exper- iment and determine its sensitivity for the detection of neutrinos from galactic supernovae. Detailed studies of material selection and geometric optimization demonstrated that graphite is the optimum material to act as a reflector. The addition of a 15 cm graphite reflector on five sides of the lead array with water and polypropylene shielding improves the neutron detection efficiency by ∼21.5\%. The detection efficiency was also optimized by selecting 3He proportional counter supports that can also act as moderators within the experiment. This simulation set demonstrated that for a shielded HALO detector with a graphite reflector the highest feasible efficiency of detected neutrons occured for a moderator geometry of four 3.0” HDPE tubes with 1.02 cm wall thickness. Monte Carlo simulations were also performed in order to determine the expected neutron capture rate in HALO due to background neutrons. Studies to optimize the geometry of the shielding indicated that 1 ft3 water boxes surrounding five sides and an 0.20 m thick polypropylene base layer reduced the detection of external neutrons from 2286 neutrons/day to 649 neutrons/day. Furthermore, the effect of $\gamma$ radiation from radioactive decay of the paint coating on the HALO blocks was shown to give an energy below the neutron energy window.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernovae are among the most fascinating phenomena in astrophysics and provide a formidable challenge for theoretical investigation. They mark the spectacular end of the lives of massive stars and, in an explosive eruption, release as much energy as the sun produces during its whole life. A better understanding of the astrophysical role of supernovae as birth sites of neutron stars, black holes, and heavy chemical elements, and more reliable predictions of the observable signals from stellar death events are tightly linked to the solution of the long-standing puzzle how collapsing stars achieve to explode. In this article our current knowledge of the processes that contribute to the success of the explosion mechanism are concisely reviewed. After a short overview of the sequence of stages of stellar core-collapse events, the general properties of the progenitor-dependent neutrino emission will be briefly described. Applying sophisticated neutrino transport in axisymmetric (2D) simulations with general relativity as well as in simulations with an approximate treatment of relativistic effects, we could find successful neutrino-driven explosions for a growing set of progenitor stars. First results of three-dimensional (3D) models have been obtained, and magnetohydrodynamic simulations demonstrate that strong initial magnetic fields in the pre-collapse core can foster the onset of neutrino-powered supernova explosions even in nonrotating stars. These results are discussed in the context of the present controversy about the value of 2D simulations for exploring the supernova mechanism in realistic 3D environments, and they are interpreted against the background of the current disagreement on the question whether the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection is the crucial agency that supports the onset of the explosion.},

Individually and in coordinated fashion, these detectors could provide temporal, energetic, angular, and flavor information for any stellar collapse in our Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, or the Small Magellanic Cloud. In this paper, we construct a detailed fiducial model of supernova neutrino bursts that incorporates the numerous emission features derived and predicted by supernova and protoneutron star theorists during the last decade. With this generic model, we calculate and predict the response of representative \v{C}erenkov and scintillation neutrino telescopes to a nearby neutrino burst. The strengths and weaknesses of the various detectors are highlighted and explored. We focus on the information-rich features of the neutrino signal that were not detectable from SN 1987A. In addition, we investigate the effect of a nonzero neutrino mass on the detected signals. The latter study focuses on what can be derived with high-resolution observations of a galactic collapse.},

We test three different equations of state commonly used in core-collapse simulations: the models of Lattimer \& Swesty (1991) with incompressibility of 180 MeV and 220 MeV, and the model of Shen et al. (1998), in order of increasing stiffness. We find that for a given neutrino luminosity the time after bounce until explosion increases with the stiffness of the equation of state: the Lattimer \& Swesty EOS explode more easily than that of Shen et al. We find this holds in both 1D and 2D, while for all models explosions are obtained more easily in 2D than in 1D.

Therefore, in this paper I describe what I think are various important facts and perspectives that may have escaped the attention of those interested in this puzzle. Furthermore, I attempt to describe the modern theory's physical underpinnings and briefly summarize the current state of play. In the process, I identify a few myths (as I see them) that have crept into modern discourse.

Observation of both neutrinos and gravitational waves from the next galactic or near extragalactic core-collapse supernova will yield a wealth of information on the explosion mechanism, but also on the structure and angular momentum of the progenitor star, and on aspects of fundamental physics such as the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities and low entropies. In this contribution to the proceedings of the Neutrino 2012 conference, we summarize recent progress made in the theoretical understanding and modeling of core-collapse supernovae. In this, our emphasis is on multi-dimensional processes involved in the explosion mechanism such as neutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion shock instability. As an example of how supernova neutrinos can be used to probe fundamental physics, we discuss how the rise time of the electron antineutrino flux observed in detectors can be used to probe the neutrino mass hierarchy. Finally, we lay out aspects of the neutrino and gravitational-wave signature of core-collapse supernovae and discuss the power of combined analysis of neutrino and gravitational wave data from the next galactic core-collapse supernova.},

We find that improvements to electron capture (EC) on nuclei, namely EC on an ensemble of nuclei using modern nuclear structure models rather than the simpler independent-particle approximation (IPA) for EC on a mean nucleus, plays the most important role during core collapse of all tested neutrino opacities. Low-energy neutrinos emitted by modern nuclear EC preferentially escape during collapse without the energy downscattering on electrons required to enhance neutrino escape and deleptonization for the models with IPA nuclear EC. During shock breakout the primary influence on the emergent neutrinos arises from NIS on electrons. For the accretion phase, non-isoenergetic scattering on free nucleons and pair emission by \$e\^{}+e\^{}-\$ annihilation have the largest impact on the neutrino emission and shock evolution. Other opacities evaluated, including nucleon--nucleon bremsstrahlung and especially neutrino--positron scattering, have little measurable impact on neutrino emission or shock dynamics. Modern treatments of nuclear electron capture, \$e\^{}+e\^{}-\$-annihilation pair emission, and non-isoenergetic scattering on electrons and free nucleons are critical elements of core-collapse simulations of all dimensionality.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernova neutrinos undergo a variety of phenomena when they travel from the high neutrino density region and large matter densities to the Earth. We perform analytical calculations of the supernova neutrino fluxes including collective effects due to the neutrino-neutrino interactions, the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect due to the neutrino interactions with the background matter and decoherence of the wave packets as they propagate in space. We predict the numbers of one- and two-neutron charged and neutral-current electron-neutrino scattering on lead events. We show that, due to the energy thresholds, the ratios of one- to two-neutron events are sensitive to the pinching parameters of neutrino fluxes at the neutrinosphere, almost independently of the presently unknown neutrino properties. Besides, such events have an interesting sensitivity to the spectral split features that depend upon the presence/absence of energy equipartition among neutrino flavors. Our calculations show that a lead-based observatory like the Helium And Lead Observatory (HALO) has the potential to pin down important characteristics of the neutrino fluxes at the neutrinosphere, and provide us with information on the neutrino transport in the supernova core.},

abstract = {The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) is a dedicated supernova detector constructed in the underground facilities at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Canada. It is designed to detect neutrinos from a supernova within the Milky Way galaxy using lead blocks and 3He neutron detectors. Analysis of supernova neutrino events can produce new discoveries in astrophysics and fundamental particle physics. HALO will be a participant in the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS), which will rely on the time delay between neutrino emission and visible light emission to provide notification to astronomers of an imminent observable supernova. This article discusses the data acquisition system of HALO, including the software ORCA, electronics components, data flow, and the design of the high-voltage and signal connections for the 3He neutron detectors.},
