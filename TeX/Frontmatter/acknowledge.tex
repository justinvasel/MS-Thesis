\chapterIntro{G}{raduate work is demanding.} It requires the student to utilize or develop many attributes; autonomy, dedication, discipline, and perseverance are a few. But, a successful post-graduate career also requires a strong support structure, on both a professional and personal level. 

There are many people that have earned my gratitude for their contribution to my success in graduate school. Dr. Alec Habig has been invaluable as a mentor. He taught me what it means to be an experimenter, and helped me stay afloat as I waded into the waters of particle physics for the first time.

Dr's. Clarence Virtue and Michael Shumacker of Laurentian University in Ontario also deserve my thanks. Their kindness and guidance made coming to an intimidating laboratory in a country I had never been to a peaceful and enjoyable experience. Being part of bringing the HALO experiment from partial-completion to near-completion has been a rewarding experience; I am grateful to have worked on a project that will someday help make historical observations.

But, perhaps there are none more deserving of my gratitude than my parents, Steve Vasel and Jennifer Olson.
